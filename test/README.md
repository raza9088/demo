## Compliance & Pi Network Branding

This project is a conceptual mockup. Any real application built for the Pi ecosystem must adhere to the Pi Network's branding guidelines and policies. This includes:
-   Using the official PiConnect SDK for wallet connections.
-   Not asking for users' private keys or passphrases.
-   Following the guidelines on the use of the Pi logo and branding.
-   Ensuring a clear distinction between the third-party app (PiPortal) and the official Pi Network app.
